# Info on Monetary Policy & the Money Supply

## Monetary Supply Overview

1. The smallest and most liquid measure, M0, is strictly currency in circulation and money being kept by banks in reserves; hence, M0 is often referred to as the "monetary base."
1. M1 is defined as all of M0 plus the remaining demand deposits not in reserves as well as travelerâ€™s checks; it is often referred to as "narrow money."
1. M2 is everything included in M1 plus savings accounts, time deposits (under $100,000), and retail money market funds.
1. M3 is everything in M2 plus larger time deposits and institutional money market funds. (Because the cost of estimating M3 was thought to outweigh its value, the Fed stopped reporting it in 2006.)

## Before May 2020, M1 consists of

1. currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and the vaults of depository institutions;
1. demand deposits at commercial banks (excluding those amounts held by depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign banks and official institutions) less cash items in the process of collection and Federal Reserve float; and
1. other checkable deposits (OCDs), consisting of negotiable order of withdrawal, or NOW, and automatic transfer service, or ATS, accounts at depository institutions, share draft accounts at credit unions, and demand deposits at thrift institutions.

## Beginning May 2020, M1 consists of

1. currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and the vaults of depository institutions;
1. demand deposits at commercial banks (excluding those amounts held by depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign banks and official institutions) less cash items in the process of collection and Federal Reserve float; and
1. other liquid deposits, consisting of OCDs and savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts).

## Before May 2020, M2 consists of M1 plus

1. savings deposits (including money market deposit accounts)
1. small-denomination time deposits (time deposits in amounts of less than $100,000) less individual retirement account (IRA) and Keogh balances at depository institutions; and
1. balances in retail money market funds (MMFs) less IRA and Keogh balances at MMFs.

## Beginning May 2020, M2 consists of M1 plus

1. small-denomination time deposits (time deposits in amounts of less than $100,000) less IRA and Keogh balances at depository institutions; and
1. balances in retail MMFs less IRA and Keogh balances at MMFs. Seasonally adjusted M2 is constructed by summing savings deposits (before May 2020), small-denomination time deposits, and retail MMFs, each seasonally adjusted separately, and adding this result to seasonally adjusted M1.
